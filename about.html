        <p>Hi, I'm Gemma and I'm just finishing up a PhD in Astronomy at the University of Sheffield. My work
        focused on finding distances to some of the most massive stars in the Milky Way, using parallaxes from the
            ESA Gaia mission's second data release (DR2). Using these distances, I was then able to investigate
            other questions about these stars, including what sorts of environments they were born in, how bright they
        really are and why some of them are travelling through space really fast!</p>

        <p>I've been lucky enough to present this work to audiences of over a hundred at three international conferences
            and I've published a couple of first author papers on the topic (alongside my supervisor and a collaborator).</p>

        <p>My research has allowed me to gain a lot of experience in using Python for data analysis (Matplotlib,
            Numpy and Pandas) and scientific computing. On top of that, I've worked on various personal and Hackathon projects.
        </p>

        <p>Since I really enjoy programming and learning about new things, I've also recently started using Javascript, CSS and
        HTML to build simple web apps. I'm also expanding into C# with a basic Naughts and Crosses app! </p>
